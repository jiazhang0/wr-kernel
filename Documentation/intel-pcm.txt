Intel Performance Counter Monitors

Certain features are only available on certain core types, please
check the Intel documentation for the package.

Collisions with other use of the counter hardware is detected by
examining the counter registers for non-zero when the pcm.x command is
started.  It will give you the opportunity to zero the counters and start
again.  Beware though that other software packages using the counters may
not be so nice, and may bulldoze use of the counters causing bad results.
