kernel-dev layer
----------------

This layer should be used when working with a local clone
of the kernel tree in the git subdirectory. It should be added 
explicitly to your bblayers.conf and the bbappend updated with the
path to the local clone of choice.


Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the oe-core version supplied with Wind River Linux.  It
also requires that the wr-kernel layer be present, and assumes you are 
building a supported BSP layer.


Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.


Building the kernel-dev layer
-----------------------------
This layer, wr-kernel and a corresponding BSP layer should be added to
bblayers.conf.  This is done automatically when using the Wind River
configure wrapper.

Note: We don't support to enable the external kernel features when building
with this layer.
