                                  CRIU 
                                  ----

1. Introduction
----------------

The criu template enables CRIU (Checkpoint Restore in Userspace) support in
the kernel and adds the criu package to the image.

Note that the criu package supports x86_64, aarch64, ARMv6 and ARMv7
architectures by far.

2. Usage
--------

For building CRIU for ARM BSPs, CRIU_BUILD_ARCH must be defined in BSP template
or local.conf file. The valid value may be "armv6" or "armv7".

For building CRIU for x86-64/aarch64 BSPs, no further action is required.

The recipe will throw warning info about supported architectures, if it is being
built on supported arch, just ignore the warning.

Add this template to your configure line:
 --with-template=feature/criu

This will ensure the required kernel config values are set.

3. Installation
----------------

This template will include criu in the root filesystem. No additional installation
steps are required.
