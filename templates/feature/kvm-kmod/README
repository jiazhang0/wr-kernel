                                  ----------

1. Introduction
----------------

The kvm-kmod template provides a mechanism to build the out-of-tree
KVM kernel modules. KVM kernel modules are provided by the
kernel source by default. When using kvm-kmod, both in-kernel and out-of-kernel
kvm kernel modules will be built; however, modprobe, depmod and other
tools will default to using the out-of-tree modules.


2. Use
-------

Simply include this template in your configure line
ie.: --with-template=feature/kvm-kmod

This will ensure that the required kernel config values are set and
include the kvm-kmod package in the root filesystem.

** Using this template causes a complete replacement of the in-tree
KVM kernel modules including any KVM patches Wind River provides
in the kernel. **


3. Installation
----------------

This template will include kvm-kmod in the root filesystem. No additional 
installation steps are required. You will find the kernel modules 
installed in /lib/modules/<kernel-version>/updates/<arch> in the root 
filesystem.


4. Updates
-----------

If new releases of kvm-kmod are available or you wish to use the
latest source available in the upstream project's git tree, you are
free to copy and update the recipe found in
recipes-kernel/kvm-kmod. As with any package in the system, the base
kvm-kmod recipe can be extended or patched in layers via bbappends
(see User's Guide for more details).
