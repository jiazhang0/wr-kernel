SUMMARY = "Userspace helper for Linux kernel EDAC drivers"
DESCRIPTION = "\
This package contains the user-space utilities for use with the EDAC \
kernel subsystem. EDAC (Error Detection and Correction) is a set of \
Linux kernel modules for handling hardware-related errors. Currently \
its major focus is ECC memory error handling. However it also detects \
and reports PCI bus parity errors. \
\
PCI parity errors are supported on all architectures (and are a mandatory \
part of the PCI specification). \
\
Main memory ECC drivers are memory controller specific. At the time of \
writing, drivers exist for many x86-specific chipsets and CPUs, and some \
PowerPC, and MIPS systems. \
